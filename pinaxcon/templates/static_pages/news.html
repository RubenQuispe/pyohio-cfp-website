<p>STUFF ABOUT BRANDON</p>

<p>Now that the program's been completed, we can also release our <a href="/about/program-transparency">Program Transparency Report</a>. While we're proud of our program, we set goals for our program and didn't achieve them all. Our report details the issues, initiatives, and next steps so we can do a better job next year.</p>

<p>We are pleased to say that X% of our speakers are women and Y% of sessions are being given by first-time speakers we helped with their proposals. All speakers are invited to a join us for a pre-event training.</p>

<p>With the conference just 6 weeks away, we've launched the <a href="/wiki">Attendee Wiki</a> so people can organize ride and roomshares, and get togethers.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks we will add a visitor's guide including gyms, restaurants, local parks, tourist attractions, and activities for people who are traveling with their families.</p>

<h2>Reflecting the Bay in the North Bay Python 2017 speaker lineup</h2>

<p><span class="date">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</span>&mdash;The organizing team wants North Bay Python to reflect the demographics of the world around us, including the speaker lineup. We are working to make that happen, and we could use your help.</p>

<p>We are <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/program/call-for-proposals">currently seeking talk proposals</a> for our inaugural conference in Petaluma, CA on December 2-3, 2017. The deadline to submit a proposal is September 29, 2017.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity for new and seasoned speakers alike, for students and professionals, for developers and researchers, for managers and hobbyists.</p>

<p>To aid those who are interested in speaking, we are happy to share ideas, help refine proposals, and provide mentorship to prospective speakers.</p>

<p>We're providing that support via email to <a href="mailto:program@northbaypython.org">program@northbaypython.org</a> and <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23nbpy">chat</a>, as needed and during the twice weekly office hours we host on Wednesdays at 3pm and Fridays at 7pm Pacific. People can tweet at us for help, too.</p>

<p>In order to decrease bias when selecting talks, our <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/program/selection-process">proposal scoring process</a> anonymizes speaker details. Accepted speakers receive a free pre-event training. We offer financial aid for speakers on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>We are doing all we can to build a great program and help excellent people get on stage.</p>

<p>You can help, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Take the stage!</strong> You should <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/program/call-for-proposals">submit a proposal</a>. Yes, you.</li>
  <li><strong>Amplify someone else's voice.</strong> Encourage someone who's never given a conference talk to submit a proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Help submitters prepare their proposals and talks:</strong> proofread, act as a rehearsal audience, offer slide design tips...</li>
  <li><strong>Pay our bills.</strong> Recommend <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/sponsors/become-a-sponsor">a sponsor</a> or throw your support behind this not-for-profit volunteer-run event as <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/about/donate">an individual donor</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have other thoughts or ideas? Please reach out to <a href="mailto:spam@northbaypython.org">spam@northbaypython.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping to make North Bay Python excellent. This is a volunteer-run conference running under the auspices of <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and none of this is possible without our advisors, our community partners, our sponsors, and you.</p>

<h2>Now accepting talk proposals for North Bay Python 2017</h2>

<p><span class="date">Monday, August 21, 2017</span>&mdash;The North Bay Python team is excited to announce that the <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/program/call-for-proposals">call for proposals</a> (CFP) is now open! We are seeking speakers of all experience levels to contribute to our inaugural conference. The CFP will close on September 29, 2017.</p>

<p>North Bay Python is a single-track event featuring two days of presentations by members of the community. The vast majority of the conference program will come from people who propose talks in our CFP process. Whether you use Python professionally, as a hobbyist, or are just excited about Python or programming and open source, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Our program committee, which is responsible for reviewing proposals, is interested in building a program that reflects the diversity of people who are using Python. Never given a presentation before but excited to share? We're here to help you craft a proposal and can refer you to quality resources for making your first conference talk. Not sure what to talk about, but interested in trying? We've got ideas for presentations we'd love to see and we're happy to share them with you!</p>

<p>In order to ensure a balanced program, we are proactively doing outreach to new and experienced speakers alike. We are also including a blind review phase in our <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/program/selection-process">selection process</a> in order to combat bias. Our goal is to have no less than 33% of our speakers be not-men, ideally 50%, and to reflect the racial diversity of United States and Bay Area demographics.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or ideas you have. You can find us on <a href="https://twitter.com/northbaypython">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/northbaypython">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23nbpy">IRC</a>, or you can <a href="mailto:program@northbaypython.org">email us</a>. Please, get started today! The <a href="https://2017.northbaypython.org/program/call-for-proposals">call for proposals</a> closes on September 29, 2017.</p>
