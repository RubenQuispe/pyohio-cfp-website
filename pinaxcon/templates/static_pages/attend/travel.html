<h3>Getting Here</h3>

<h4>By Car</h4>

<p>If you're driving up, Downtown Petaluma is at exit 472A on Highway 101, 35 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge. All parking is free in Petaluma, including in the undercover garages at Keller St and Theatre Square. Both garages are in short walking distance of the Mystic.</p>

<h4>By Bus</h4>

<p>Public transit to Petaluma is not great. You can take the 101 bus operated by Golden Gate Transit from downtown San Francisco, or south from Santa Rosa. Depending on sponsorship, we hope to run a free shuttle with BART and Caltrain connections for people from further out of town.</p>

<h4>By Plane</h4>

<p>If you're coming from out of the area, you may want to consider Sonoma County Airport (STS). STS is 30 minutes out of Petaluma, and has nonstop flights to most major west coast cities. If you can't make it to STS, you can also try San Francisco (SFO) or Oakland (OAK) international airports.</p>

<p>If you happen to have an aircraft of your own, Petaluma Municipal Airport is 3 miles down the road.</p>
