<p>If you can’t afford to attend on these prices, please email <a href="mailto:spam@northbaypthon.org">spam@northbaypython.org</a> – we’ll enthusiastically waive ticket fees for people who need it.</em></p>

<h3>Individual Sponsor</h3>

<p>This ticket includes all of the benefits of a Corporate ticket, but we’ll also give the ticket holder special thanks during our conference plenary sessions. You can also provide us with a promotional item to put in each attendee’s swag bag.</p>

<p>This ticket is for individuals who want to sponsor the conference. For company-level sponsorships, please see our <a href="/sponsors/become-a-sponsor">sponsorships page</a>.</p>

<h3>Corporate</h3>

<p>This ticket is designed for companies and individuals who can legitimately claim the cost of attending the conference as a business expense or a tax deduction. It includes a free t-shirt, and recognition of your affiliation on your conference badge and on the conference supporters list.</p>

<p>For companies sending multiple attendees, you can get a 10% discount off the regular price on purchases of 5 tickets or more.</p>

<h3>Individual Supporter</h3>

<p>This ticket is designed for individuals who want to financially contribute to the success of the conference. It includes a complimentary t-shirt, and recognition of your Free and Open Source Software, hobby, or nonprofit project on your conference badge.</p>

<h3>Unaffiliated Individual</h3>

<p>The cheapest ticket we can offer. This is designed for students, hobbyists, and unemployed/underemployed people who are coming to North Bay Python at their own expense. You can add a t-shirt for $30.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<h3>Group Discounts</h3>
<p>Corporate-level tickets are available at a 10% discount if your organization buys 5 or more tickets. To claim, buy your first four tickets, and send us an email with the names and receipt numbers for those attendees. We’ll send you vouchers for a discount on further tickets.</p>

<h3>Conference access</h3>
<p>Two days of high-caliber talks about Python, and meeting new Pythonistas at North Bay Python.</p>

<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>In order to keep ticket costs as low as possible, we won’t be catering lunch this year.</p>

<p>To make up for it, we’ve located our conference right in the middle of Historic Downtown Petaluma’s restaurant district. You can find everything from market delis and barbecue, through to Michelin-rated restaurants, all within 5 minutes walk. You’ll get a better lunch than we’d ever be able to cater, for much less. We'll have a locals' guide to Petaluma to help you find places to eat.</p>

<h3>Morning Refreshments (TBA)</h3>
<p>If budget permits, or if we find a sponsor, we’ll provide coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and some light snacks in the morning before proceedings kick off on both days.</p>

<h3>T-Shirt</h3>
<p>We’ll be designing a collectible North Bay Python t-shirt for you to pick up at the conference, and they’ll be available in a variety of cuts and colors. Each t-shirt costs $30, and for supporter, corporate, and sponsor ticket holders, you’ll get your first t-shirt free!</p>

<h3>Affiliation</h3>
<p>Every attendee gets their very own lanyard and a badge with their name on it. As a paying ticket holder, you’ll get your project’s name (supporter and above) or company name (corporate or sponsor levels only) on your badge, just below your name.</p>

<h3>Supporter Recognition</h3>
<p>On our website, we’ll have a list of our conference supporters. You can choose to have your name on that list.</p>

<p>For our corporate and sponsor ticket holders, we’ll also include your company name as part of those thanks.</p>

<h3>Sponsor Benefits</h3>
<p>Sponsor tickets come with sponsor benefits. To find out more, see our <a href="/sponsors/become-a-sponsor">Sponsors page</a>.</p>
