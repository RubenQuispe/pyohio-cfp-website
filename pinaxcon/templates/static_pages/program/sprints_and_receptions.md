PyOhio attendees are invited to informal reception and sprint sessions. These events are meant for anyone who would like to meet up with other attendees for informal discussion and/or coding.

## Sprints

*Check back soon for sprint times and directions*

For those unfamiliar with the term: sprints are cooperative coding sessions where you work side-by-side with other PyOhio participants to improve an open-source project.

You can:

- Write something new
- Extend an existing package (yours, or someone else's)
- Fix bugs
- Write tests
- Improve documentation

It's a great way to contribute to the community, learn about coding and open-source contribution, and have fun with new and old PyOhio friends.

## Schedule

## What you need

*Experience not needed* - sprinting is actually a great way to <em>gain</em> experience. Just bring a laptop!
